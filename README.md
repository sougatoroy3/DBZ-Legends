# DBZ-Legends
Just a simple UI-based app for all the DBZ fans. You can tap on the different characters and they'll tell you bout themselves in their own sick style. You can even get the DBZ WARRIOR vibes when you hear the power-up tracks of the characters. Goku's super chill attitude and craving to train more and get stronger day by day, Vegeta the Saiyan Prince's pride and merciless nature, Gohan's, the rage of a soft-hearted Saiyan warrior and Piccolo's Namekian instincts and abilities.

Initially made in Swift playgrounds. 
The resource file was cloned from Paul Hudson's Subsonic package. Will add the link below.

# Steps to Run
Clone the folder and run it from the Swift Playgrounds app.
You may even use XCode or VSCode to run it.

=======
*Note you'll need the swift toolchain and compiler to run it on a Windows machine*

# Disclaimer
This is just a preview of the complete app. I'm still working on it. Your criticisms, ideas, and suggestions are always welcome.
